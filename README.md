# Py2048-ML
I initially created this project to learn about neural networks and reinforcement learning. The main goal was to create a technically correct implementation of a simple feed-forward neural network, as well as the Q-Learning algorithm used by DeepMind in 2013 to play Atari [link to paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602). In this regard, the project was a resounding success. However, since education (and not model performance) was the primary goal of the project, the performance is unsurprisingly unimpressive. After thousands of training epochs, the model simply always tries moves in the same order until a legal move is found (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, UP). While this is a reasonable strategy that most people tend to arrive at when they play the game, it isn't exactly insightful. Whether this strategy is the result of an insufficiently expressive network architecture, or a flaw in the RL methdology is yet to be explored.

A version of the game 2048 can be played with keyboard input by running the file game2048.py.
